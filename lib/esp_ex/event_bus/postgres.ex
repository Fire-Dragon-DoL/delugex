  This is the real implementation of EventBus. It will execute the needed
  queries on Postgres through Postgrex by calling the functions provided in
  [ESP](https://github.com/Carburetor/ESP/tree/master/app/config/functions/stream). You should be able to infer what to write, it's just passing the
  required arguments to the SQL functions and converting any returned value.
  Whenever a stream name is expected, please use the %StreamName struct and
  make sure to convert it to string.

  Write has an expected_version argument. This argument could be one of:

  - NoStream: no message ever written to this stream, the Postgres

    are present)
  - A number (0+): Representing the expected version
